# Redux Feedback Form

_Duration: 2 Day Sprint_

## Description

This app takes in user feedback about how they are feeling, how well they are understanding the class content, if they feel supported, and any comments they have.

### Prerequisites

## Installation

1. Create a database named `your database name`,
2. The queries in the `tables.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries, 
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
4. Run `npm run server` in your terminal
5. Run `npm run client` in your terminal
6. The `npm run client` command will open up a new browser tab for you!
